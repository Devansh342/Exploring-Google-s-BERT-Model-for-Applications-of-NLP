# Exploring-Google-s-BERT-Model-for-Applications-of-NLP
Implementation of different NLP applications using and exploration of Google's BERT model

- As part of mini project I undertook the project "Exploring BERT model for Applications of NLP".

- Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, a state-of-art model, Study and implementation of BERT model for numerous NLP applications, exploring & working on literature survey of other pre-trained models for implementations of NLP applications like Sentiment analysis, Text summarization, Question Answering, etc. Pre-Final semester project under guidance of Dr. S.K. Bharti.

- Implemented Sentiment analysis of movie reviews and compared the results between NLTK - traditional model and Google's BERT model.

- Explored and studied different NLP language models - BERT, GPT2, XLNet and implemented extractive text summarization.
